Group Discussion Topic: The impact of social media on body image, especially among young adults.

Male:
1. I think social media definitely plays a role, you know?  You see all these filtered photos and perfect bodies, and it's easy to start comparing yourself. It can make you feel like you're not good enough.
2. But on the flip side, there are also a lot of body-positive accounts and movements on social media now.  People are celebrating different body types and promoting self-acceptance, which is great.
3. It really comes down to being mindful of who you follow and how you engage with social media.  Like, unfollowing accounts that make you feel bad about yourself can be a huge help.

Female:
1. Totally agree. It's so easy to get caught up in the highlight reel that everyone presents online. You forget that most of it isn't real.  People only post their best angles and edit their flaws.
2. I also think the algorithms play a big part. Social media platforms show you what they think you want to see, which can sometimes create an echo chamber of unrealistic beauty standards.
3. It's important to remember that everyone is different and beautiful in their own way.  Focusing on health and well-being, rather than chasing an ideal image, is much more beneficial.

        "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Unlike Flask, which is a lightweight framework, FastAPI is specifically built for creating fast APIs with automatic validation, OpenAPI documentation, and asynchronous support. You should use FastAPI when building APIs that require high performance and asynchronous capabilities.",
        "Event logging is a mechanism in software development that involves capturing and storing information about events or actions that occur during the execution of a program. Events can include errors, warnings, user interactions, system events, and other relevant information. Event logging is commonly used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing the behavior and performance of software systems. It can provide valuable insights into the runtime behavior of a program and help in identifying and resolving issues.",
        "Asymptotic notations describe the upper and/or lower bounds on algorithm complexity. Common notations include Big O, Omega, and Theta notation. Big O describes the upper bound on worst-case time complexity, Omega describes the lower bound on best-case time complexity, and Theta describes both upper and lower bounds. They are used to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency.",
        "Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world, typically created using computer technology. Types of VR systems include desktop-based VR, mobile-based VR, and headset-based VR. Applications of VR include gaming, education and training, healthcare, architecture and design, and entertainment.",
        "The Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, provides a powerful way to process sequences of elements (e.g., from collections) using a functional approach. Streams allow you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing data in a concise and readable manner. They are important because they enable more expressive and parallelizable code for handling collections of data."
